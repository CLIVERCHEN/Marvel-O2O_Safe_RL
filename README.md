 official implementation of *Marvel: Accelerating Safe Online Reinforcement Learning with Finetuned Offline Policy* (https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04426)
 
Marvel is a novel framework for offline-to-online (O2O) safe reinforcement learning (RL) that bridges the gap between offline learning from static datasets and online policy finetuning. This framework addresses key challenges in safe RL, such as **erroneous Q-estimations** and **Lagrangian mismatches**, providing a more efficient and safer way to leverage offline data for online learning.
